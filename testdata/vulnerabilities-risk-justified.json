      "risk_score": 3,
      "risk_justification": "The calculated Low risk level (score 3) for CVE-2018-13379 on loadbalancer2.intranet.techcompany.com is appropriate despite the medium severity vulnerability because two key factors mitigate the risk. First, the Quality environment presents less attractive targets for attackers compared to production environments, reducing the likelihood of exploitation. Second, the Medium asset criticality indicates this is not a business-critical system, limiting the potential business impact if compromised. While the file leak vulnerability in FortiOS SSL VPN is serious (allowing unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive system files), these contextual factors reasonably downgrade the overall risk from the base Medium severity to a calculated Low risk in this specific implementation."
